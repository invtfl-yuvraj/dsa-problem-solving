# Search Insert Position

## Overview

This repository contains a solution to the "Search Insert Position" problem. The task is to find the index where the target value would be inserted in a sorted array.

## Problem Statement

Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

**Example 1:**
- Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 6], target = 5
- Output: 2

**Example 2:**
- Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 6], target = 2
- Output: 1

**Example 3:**
- Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 6], target = 7
- Output: 4

## Your Task:

You are required to implement the function `searchInsert()`, which takes a sorted array `nums[]`, its length `n`, and a target value `target`. The function should return the index where the target value would be inserted in order.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(log n)

**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
