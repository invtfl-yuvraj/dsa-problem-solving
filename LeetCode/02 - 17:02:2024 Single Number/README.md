# Single Number

## Overview

This repository contains a solution to the "Single Number" problem. The task is to find the single number that appears only once in an array where every other element appears twice.

## Problem Statement

Given a non-empty array of integers `nums`, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
- nums = [2,2,1]

**Output:**
- 1

### Example 2:

**Input:**
- nums = [4,1,2,1,2]

**Output:**
- 4

### Example 3:

**Input:**
- nums = [1]

**Output:**
- 1

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
- -3 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10^4
- Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

## Implementation

The solution is implemented in C++ and provided in the `solution.cpp` file.

## How to Use

To use this solution:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `solution.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable file.
4. The program will prompt you to input the array for which you want to find the missing element.
5. The program will output the missing element.
