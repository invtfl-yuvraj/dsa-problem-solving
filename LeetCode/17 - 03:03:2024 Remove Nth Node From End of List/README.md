# Remove Nth Node From End of List

## Overview

This repository contains a solution to the "Remove Nth Node From End of List" problem. The task is to remove the nth node from the end of a linked list and return its head.

## Problem Statement

Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

**Example 1:**
- Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
- Output: [1,2,3,5]

**Example 2:**
- Input: head = [1], n = 1
- Output: []

**Example 3:**
- Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
- Output: [1]

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is sz.
- 1 <= sz <= 30
- 0 <= Node.val <= 100
- 1 <= n <= sz

## Your Task:  

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `removeNthFromEnd()` which takes the head of the linked list and an integer `n` as input arguments and returns the head of the modified linked list.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(sz)
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

## How to Use
