# Squares of a Sorted Array

## Overview

This repository contains a solution to the "Squares of a Sorted Array" problem. The task is to return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

**Example 1:**
- Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
- Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
- Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100]. After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].

**Example 2:**
- Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
- Output: [4,9,9,49,121]

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= nums.length <= 104
- -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
- nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

**Follow up:** Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial, could you find an O(n) solution using a different approach?

## Your Task:

You are required to implement the function `sortedSquares()` that takes an integer array `nums` as input and returns an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(n)
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(n)
