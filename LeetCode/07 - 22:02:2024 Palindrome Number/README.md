# Palindrome Number

## Overview

This repository contains a solution to the "Palindrome Number" problem. The task is to determine whether a given integer is a palindrome or not.

## Problem Statement

Given an integer `x`, return true if `x` is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

**Example 1:**
- Input: x = 121
- Output: true
- Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

**Example 2:**
- Input: x = -121
- Output: false
- Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore, it is not a palindrome.

**Example 3:**
- Input: x = 10
- Output: false
- Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore, it is not a palindrome.

**Constraints:**
- -2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1

## How to Use
