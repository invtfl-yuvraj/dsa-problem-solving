# Check if Array is Sorted

## Overview

This repository contains a solution to the "Check if Array is Sorted" problem. The task is to check if an array is sorted in non-decreasing order or not.

## Problem Statement

Given an array `arr[]` of size N, check if it is sorted in non-decreasing order or not.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
- N = 5
- arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}

**Output:**
- 1

**Explanation:**
The given array is sorted.

### Example 2:

**Input:**
- N = 6
- arr[] = {90, 80, 100, 70, 40, 30}

**Output:**
- 0

**Explanation:**
The given array is not sorted.

## Approach

The solution involves traversing the array and checking if each element is less than or equal to its next element. If any element violates this condition, the array is not sorted.

## Implementation

The solution is implemented in C++ in the `solution.cpp` file.


## How to Use
To use this solution:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `solution.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable file.
4. The program will prompt you to input the array for which you want to find the missing element.
5. The program will output the missing element.
