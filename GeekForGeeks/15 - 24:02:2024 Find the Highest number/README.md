# Find the Highest Number

## Overview

This repository contains a solution to the "Find the Highest Number" problem. The task is to find the highest element in an array initially in increasing order, then in decreasing order.

## Problem Statement

Given an array in such a way that the elements stored in the array are in increasing order initially and then after reaching a peak element, the elements stored are in decreasing order. Find the highest element. Note: A[i] != A[i+1]

**Example 1:**
- Input: 11
  Array: 1 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1
- Output: 6
- Explanation: The highest element is 6.

**Example 2:**
- Input: 5
  Array: 1 2 3 4 5
- Output: 5
- Explanation: The highest element is 5.

## Your Task:

You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `findPeakElement()` which takes the array as the input parameter and returns the highest element.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(log(n))
**Expected Space Complexity:** O(1)
