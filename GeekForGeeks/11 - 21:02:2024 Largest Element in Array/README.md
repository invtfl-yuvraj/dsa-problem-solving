# Largest Element in Array

## Overview

This repository contains a solution to the "Largest Element in Array" problem. The task is to find the largest element in an array.

## Problem Statement

Given an array `A[]` of size `n`, find the largest element in it.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
- n = 5
- A[] = {1, 8, 7, 56, 90}

**Output:**
- 90

**Explanation:**
The largest element in the given array is 90.

### Example 2:

**Input:**
- n = 7
- A[] = {1, 2, 0, 3, 2, 4, 5}

**Output:**
- 5

**Explanation:**
The largest element in the given array is 5.

## Your Task

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `largest()` which takes the array `A[]` and its size `n` as inputs and returns the maximum element in the array.

### Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3
- 0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^3
- Array may contain duplicate elements.

## How to Use
To use this solution:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `solution.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable file.
4. The program will prompt you to input the array for which you want to find the missing element.
5. The program will output the missing element.
