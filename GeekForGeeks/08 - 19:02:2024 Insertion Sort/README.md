# Insertion Sort

## Overview

This repository contains a solution to the "Insertion Sort" problem. The task is to implement the `insert()` function, which is used to implement Insertion Sort.

## Problem Statement

The task is to complete the `insert()` function, which is used to implement Insertion Sort.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
- N = 5
- arr[] = {4, 1, 3, 9, 7}

**Output:**
- 1 3 4 7 9

### Example 2:

**Input:**
- N = 10
- arr[] = {10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1}

**Output:**
- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

## Approach

The solution involves the Insertion Sort algorithm, where the `insert()` function is used to sort the array by moving through the array and inserting each element at its correct position.

## Implementation

The solution is implemented in C++ in the `solution.cpp` file.

## How to Use
To use this solution:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `solution.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable file.
4. The program will prompt you to input the array for which you want to find the missing element.
5. The program will output the missing element.
