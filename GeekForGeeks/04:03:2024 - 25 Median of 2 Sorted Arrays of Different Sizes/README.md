# Median of 2 Sorted Arrays of Different Sizes

## Overview

This repository contains a solution to the "Median of 2 Sorted Arrays of Different Sizes" problem. The task is to find the median of two sorted arrays.

## Problem Statement

Given two sorted arrays `array1` and `array2` of size `m` and `n` respectively. Find the median of the two sorted arrays.

**Example 1:**
- Input:
  m = 3, n = 4
  array1[] = {1, 5, 9}
  array2[] = {2, 3, 6, 7}
- Output: 5
- Explanation: The middle element for {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9} is 5.

**Example 2:**
- Input:
  m = 2, n = 4
  array1[] = {4, 6}
  array2[] = {1, 2, 3, 5}
- Output: 3.5

## Your Task:

The task is to complete the function `MedianOfArrays()` that takes `array1` and `array2` as input and returns their median.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(min(log n, log m)).
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O((n+m)/2).

## How to Use
