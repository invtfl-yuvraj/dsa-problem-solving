# Check if a number is divisible by 8

## Overview

This repository contains a solution to the "Check if a number is divisible by 8" problem. The task is to check whether a given string representation of a decimal number is divisible by 8.

## Problem Statement

Given a string representation of a decimal number s, check whether it is divisible by 8.

**Example 1:**
- Input:
  s = "16"
- Output:
  1
- Explanation:
  The given number is divisible by 8,
  so the driver code prints 1 as the output.

**Example 2:**
- Input:
  s = "54141111648421214584416464555"
- Output:
  -1
- Explanation:
  Given Number is not divisible by 8,
  so the driver code prints -1 as the output.

## Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function `DivisibleByEight()` which takes a string s as the input and returns 1 if the number is divisible by 8, else it returns -1.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(1).
**Expected Auxillary Space:** O(1).
