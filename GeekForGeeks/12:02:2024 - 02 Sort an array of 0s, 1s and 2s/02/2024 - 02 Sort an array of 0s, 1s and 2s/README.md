## Sort an Array of 0s, 1s, and 2s

# Overview
This repository contains a solution to the "Sort an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s" problem from Geek For Geeks DSA. The problem involves sorting an array containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s in ascending order.

# Contents
`solution.cpp` : C++ implementation of the solution.
`README.md` : Documentation providing an overview of the problem, approach, implementation, and instructions on how to use the solution.

# Problem Statement
Given an array of size N containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s; sort the array in ascending order.

### Example 1:
#### Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {0, 2, 1, 2, 0}
Output : 0 0 1 2 2

#### Explanation:
0s, 1s, and 2s are segregated into ascending order.

### Example 2:
#### Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {0, 1, 0}
Output: 0 0 1

#### Explanation:
0s, 1s, and 2s are segregated into ascending order.

## Approach
The solution involves using the Dutch National Flag algorithm to sort the array with three different elements (0, 1, and 2) in linear time.

## Implementation
The solution is implemented in C++ in the `solution.cpp` file.

## How to Use
To use this solution:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `solution.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable file.
4. The program will prompt you to input the array for which you want to find the missing element.
5. The program will output the missing element.
