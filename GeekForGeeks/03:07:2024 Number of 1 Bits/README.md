# Number of 1 Bits

## Problem Statement

Given a positive integer N, print the count of set bits (1s) in its binary representation.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

**Input:**
N = 6

**Output:**
2

**Explanation:**
Binary representation of 6 is '110', so the count of set bits is 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:**
N = 8

**Output:**
1

**Explanation:**
Binary representation of 8 is '1000', so the count of set bits is 1.

## Constraints

- \( 1 \leq N \leq 10^9 \)

## Expected Time Complexity

- O(log N)

## Expected Auxiliary Space

- O(1)

## Approach

1. **Convert to Binary:** Convert the number to its binary representation.
2. **Count Set Bits:** Count the number of '1's in the binary representation.
